# Autonomous Squad Assault
MultiAgent Systems Grad School Project

Autonomous robotic military forces will eventually replace human soldiers. Related work shows
that autonomous robotic teams can self-organize, plan, and execute surveillance and rescue
operations. This project builds on related work and ideas to develop a simulated autonomous
robotic infantry squad that can plan and execute a squad assault to capture an objective
defended by a small opposing force while obeying ethical warfare standards.
