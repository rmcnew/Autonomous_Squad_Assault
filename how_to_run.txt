Autonomous Squad Assault was developed using Python 3.5.3 on Linux.

It should be able to run under on other platforms that support Python 3, but it has not been tested exhaustively.

These instructions assume that you have little to no Python background, but should enable you to get Autonomous Squad Assault running.

1.  Install Python 3 on your platform.

If you are using Linux or macOS, there's a good chance that you might have Python already installed.  Open a terminal
and try running "python3 --version".  If you are on another platform, point your web browser to https://www.python.org,
download the latest release for your platform and follow the installation instructions for your platform.

2.  Install virtualenv.

virtualenv is a localized Python package management system that allows Python packages to be installed locally for
Python projects.    Follow the virtualenv installation instructions at
https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtualenv/

3.  Create a virtualenv environment

In the Autonomous Squad Assault directory, run the following command:

python3 -m venv .venv

This will create an empty virtualenv environment in the ".venv" directory.  This allows Autonomous Squad Assault requirements to be
installed locally.

4.  Activate the virtualenv environment

In the Autonomous Squad Assault directory, run the following command:

source .venv/bin/activate

This should prepend "(.venv)" to your shell prompt, letting you know that you are in the virtualenv.

5.  Install Autonomous Squad Assault Python requirements

While inside the virtualenv and in the Autonomous Squad Assault directory, run the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install the Python packages needed to run Autonomous Squad Assault in the virtualenv.

6.  Run the program

python3 auto_assault.py
